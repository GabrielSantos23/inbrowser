## Monorepo Structure

InBrowser is built as a monorepo using **Bun Workspaces**, organizing code into applications and shared packages.

### Apps

- **`apps/server`**: The backend API service built with [Hono](https://hono.dev). Handles file uploads, processing, and streaming.
- **`apps/web`**: The frontend user interface (React/Vite).
- **`apps/docs`**: This documentation site (Mintlify).

### Packages

- **`packages/api`**: Shared API definitions, including tRPC routers and types used by both server and web clients.
- **`packages/db`**: Database schemas and client (if applicable).

## Core Technologies

- **Runtime**: [Bun](https://bun.sh) (fast JavaScript runtime & package manager)
- **Backend**: Hono (Edge-ready web framework)
- **Media Processing**: FFmpeg (via `Bun.spawn`)
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript & tRPC

## Running Locally for Development

To work on the project, you typically run the backend and frontend services simultaneously.

1.  **Backend (Server)**

    ```bash
    cd apps/server
    bun run dev
    # Runs on http://localhost:3000
    ```

2.  **Frontend (Web)**

    ```bash
    cd apps/web
    bun run dev
    # Runs on http://localhost:5173 (usually)
    ```

3.  **Documentation**
    ```bash
    cd apps/docs
    mint dev
    # Runs on http://localhost:3001
    ```

## Code Standards

- **Linting**: We use Biome or ESLint.
- **Formatting**: Prettier/Biome.
- **Commits**: Follow conventional commits (e.g., `feat: add pdf support`).
