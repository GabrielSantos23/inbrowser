## Prerequisites

Before running the project locally, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Bun** (v1.x or higher) - Used as the package manager and runtime.
- **Node.js** (v20+ recommended) - Required for some build tools.
- **FFmpeg** - Essential for media conversion (video/audio).
  - _Linux (Arch)_: `sudo pacman -S ffmpeg`
  - _Linux (Ubuntu)_: `sudo apt install ffmpeg`
  - _macOS_: `brew install ffmpeg`

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/InBrowser.git
    cd InBrowser
    ```

2.  Install dependencies using Bun:

    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

## Running the Server

Start the backend development server from the project root:

```bash
# Navigate to server app
cd apps/server

# Start dev server
bun run dev
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Example: Convert a File

You can verify the setup by converting a simple text file to PDF.

1.  Create a sample file:

    ```bash
    echo "Hello World" > test.txt
    ```

2.  Send a conversion request:

    ```bash
    curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/convert \
      -F "file=@test.txt" \
      -F "format=pdf" \
      --output test.pdf
    ```

3.  Check the result:
    You should see `test.pdf` in your directory.
